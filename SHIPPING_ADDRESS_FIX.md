# Shipping Address Fix - Summary

## 🔧 Issue Identified

**Problem:** Order details page was showing "No shipping address provided" even though shipping address collection was enabled in Stripe checkout.

**Root Cause:** The webhook was trying to access `shipping_details` property which doesn't exist on Stripe's Session object. Stripe actually stores the shipping/billing address in `customer_details.address`.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changed in: `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

#### Before (Incorrect):
```typescript
const sessionData = retrievedSession as any;
const shippingDetails = sessionData.shipping_details;  // ❌ Wrong property
const address = shippingDetails?.address;

// Later in order creation:
shippingName: shippingDetails?.name,  // ❌ Would be null
shippingAddressLine1: address?.line1,  // ❌ Would be null
```

#### After (Correct):
```typescript
// Stripe stores customer info in customer_details
const customerDetails = retrievedSession.customer_details;  // ✅ Correct
const shippingDetails = (retrievedSession as any).shipping_details || (retrievedSession as any).shipping;

// Use customer_details.address (this is where Stripe puts the shipping address)
const shippingAddress = shippingDetails?.address || customerDetails?.address;  // ✅ Fallback logic
const shippingName = shippingDetails?.name || customerDetails?.name;

// Later in order creation:
shippingName: shippingName,  // ✅ Will have value
shippingAddressLine1: shippingAddress?.line1,  // ✅ Will have value
```

## 📊 How Stripe Checkout Works

### When `shipping_address_collection` is enabled:

```typescript
// In app/actions/stripe.ts
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  shipping_address_collection: {
    allowed_countries: ['US', 'CA', 'GB', 'AU', 'DE', 'FR'],
  },
  // ...
});
```

### Stripe stores the address in `customer_details`:

```json
{
  "customer_details": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "address": {
      "line1": "123 Main St",
      "line2": "Apt 4B",
      "city": "New York",
      "state": "NY",
      "postal_code": "10001",
      "country": "US"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Stripe may also have a separate `shipping_details` or `shipping` property in some cases, so the fix includes fallback logic to check both.

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Create a New Test Order

1. **Clear your cart** (if you have items)
2. **Add a product to cart**
3. **Go to checkout**
4. **Complete the Stripe checkout form:**
   - Card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Expiry: Any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
   - **Shipping Address:**
     - Name: `Test User`
     - Address: `123 Test Street`
     - City: `Test City`
     - State: `CA`
     - ZIP: `12345`
     - Country: `United States`

5. **Complete payment**

### 2. Verify Shipping Address is Saved

#### Check in Database:
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
- Navigate to `Order` table
- Find your latest order
- Verify these fields are populated:
  - ✅ `shippingName`: "Test User"
  - ✅ `shippingAddressLine1`: "123 Test Street"
  - ✅ `shippingCity`: "Test City"
  - ✅ `shippingState`: "CA"
  - ✅ `shippingPostalCode`: "12345"
  - ✅ `shippingCountry`: "US"

#### Check in Order Details Page:
1. Go to `/dashboard/orders`
2. Click on your latest order
3. Scroll to "Shipping Address" section
4. **Should now show:**
   ```
   📍 Shipping Address
   ─────────────────────
   Test User
   123 Test Street
   Test City, CA 12345
   United States
   ```

#### Check Webhook Logs:
```bash
# In your terminal where the dev server is running
# Look for:
=== SHIPPING INFORMATION DEBUG ===
Customer details: {
  name: 'Test User',
  email: '...',
  address: { line1: '123 Test Street', ... }
}
Final extracted shipping info: {
  name: 'Test User',
  addressLine1: '123 Test Street',
  city: 'Test City',
  state: 'CA',
  postalCode: '12345',
  country: 'US'
}
```

### 3. Verify Receipt Printing

1. On the order details page
2. Click **"Print Receipt"**
3. Verify shipping address appears in the receipt

## 🔍 Debugging

If shipping address still doesn't show:

### 1. Check Webhook Logs

Look for the debug output in your terminal:
```
=== SHIPPING INFORMATION DEBUG ===
Customer details: { ... }
Shipping details (if separate): { ... }
Final extracted shipping info: { ... }
```

### 2. Verify Stripe Checkout Configuration

In `app/actions/stripe.ts`, ensure both functions have:
```typescript
shipping_address_collection: {
    allowed_countries: ['US', 'CA', 'GB', 'AU', 'DE', 'FR'],
},
```

### 3. Check Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments
2. Find your payment
3. Click on it
4. Check if "Shipping details" or "Customer details" shows the address

### 4. Test with Stripe CLI

```bash
# Listen to webhooks locally
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# In another terminal, trigger a test checkout
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```
