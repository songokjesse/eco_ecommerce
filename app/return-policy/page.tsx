                            At CircuCity, we are committed to providing a safe, transparent, and sustainable marketplace for buying, selling, and (in the future) swapping second-hand items. As a peer-to-peer platform connecting private individuals, CircuCity operates primarily as a marketplace facilitating transactions between users rather than acting as a direct seller.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                            This Return Policy explains the rules for returns, refunds, and remedies in line with Swedish consumer law, EU regulations, and our platform's features. Please read it carefully before making a purchase.

                            <li><strong>Peer-to-Peer Nature:</strong> Most transactions on CircuCity occur between private users (C2C). Under Swedish and EU law, sales between private individuals are generally not covered by the statutory 14-day right of withdrawal (ångerrätt) that applies to distance contracts with professional traders. There is no automatic right to return an item simply because you changed your mind, it doesn't fit, or you no longer want it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Buyer Protection & Remedies:</strong> CircuCity provides Buyer Protection for eligible issues. Refunds are available if an item does not arrive, arrives damaged, or is significantly not as described in the listing (e.g., wrong item, major condition mismatch, or undisclosed defects).</li>
                            <li><strong>Professional Sellers:</strong> If you purchase from a verified professional/business seller on CircuCity (if/when we introduce such options), additional consumer rights may apply, including the 14-day right of withdrawal and the 3-year complaint period under the Swedish Consumer Sales Act (Konsumentköplagen). Such sellers must clearly state their terms.</li>

                            <li><strong>Full Refund:</strong> Issued if the claim is valid (e.g., not as described, lost, damaged). The refund includes the item price, platform fees (if applicable), but typically excludes original shipping unless the seller agrees or fault lies with shipping.</li>
                            <li><strong>Partial Refund:</strong> Offered as an alternative (e.g., minor issue) if both parties agree.</li>
                            <li><strong>Return Requested:</strong>

                                    <li>If approved, you must return the item in the same condition received (including original packaging where possible) within 5 business days of approval.</li>
                                    <li>Return shipping is usually paid by the buyer unless the seller agrees otherwise or the issue is clearly the seller's fault (e.g., wrong item sent).</li>
                                    <li>Once the seller confirms receipt of the returned item in acceptable condition, the refund is processed.</li>

                            <li><strong>Seller-Issued Remedies:</strong> Sellers may offer partial refunds, replacements, or accept returns directly. CircuCity encourages amicable resolutions.</li>

                            Refunds are processed back to the original payment method via our secure payment provider. Processing time is typically 5–10 business days.
