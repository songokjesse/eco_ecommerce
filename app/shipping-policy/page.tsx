                            At CircuCity, we make shipping second-hand items simple, reliable, and as sustainable as possible. As a peer-to-peer circular marketplace, CircuCity integrates secure payment and logistics partners to handle transactions between buyers and sellers in Sweden and potentially other EU/EEA countries (features expanding over time).

                            <li><strong>Buyer Pays for Shipping:</strong> Shipping costs are added to the item price and displayed in the total at checkout. The buyer selects and pays for the preferred shipping method.</li>
                            <li><strong>Integrated Shipping Labels:</strong> For most transactions, CircuCity generates a prepaid shipping label automatically after payment. This is the recommended and most secure method.

                                    <li>Seller receives a printable label (PDF) or QR code/digital option via their account or email.</li>

                            <li><strong>Custom/Non-Integrated Shipping (limited use):</strong> Allowed only in specific cases (e.g., oversized items, special requests). Buyer and seller agree on method and cost privately, but CircuCity strongly recommends integrated options for Buyer Protection and tracking. Off-platform arrangements carry higher risk.</li>
                            <li><strong>No Off-Platform Payments or Shipping:</strong> CircuCity never encourages payments or shipping arrangements outside the platform.</li>
