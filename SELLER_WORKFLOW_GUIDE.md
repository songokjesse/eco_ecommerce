# Seller Workflow: From Payment to Delivery

This document explains the complete workflow for sellers after a buyer makes a payment on CircuCity.

## 📋 Overview

When a buyer completes payment, the seller needs to:
1. **View the paid order**
2. **Create a shipment** (generates shipping label)
3. **Ship the package** (using the PostNord label)
4. **Track delivery** (automatic updates)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Create Shipment" button not showing
- **Check**: Is the order status `PAID`?
- **Check**: Have you already created a shipment for this order?
- **Solution**: Only PAID orders without shipments show this button

### Shipping label not downloading
- **Check**: Is your popup blocker enabled?
- **Solution**: Allow popups for this site
- **Alternative**: Check the shipment details page for label URL

### Wrong shipping address
- **Issue**: Customer provided incorrect address
- **Solution**: Contact customer to update address before shipping
- **Note**: Address comes from buyer's checkout information

### Package not picked up by PostNord
- **Check**: Did you drop it at the correct PostNord location?
- **Check**: Is the label attached and visible?
- **Solution**: Contact PostNord customer service

### Tracking not updating
- **Reason**: PostNord may take time to scan packages
- **Solution**: Wait a few hours and click "Refresh"
- **Note**: Initial scan happens when PostNord picks up the package
