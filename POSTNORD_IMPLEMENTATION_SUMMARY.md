## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Get PostNord Credentials
Visit https://developer.postnord.com/ and:
1. Create an account
2. Generate sandbox API keys
3. Note your Customer ID

### 2. Configure Environment
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
POSTNORD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
POSTNORD_CUSTOMER_ID=your_customer_id_here
POSTNORD_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

### 3. Integrate into Your Pages

**For Order Details Page:**
```tsx
import ShipmentTracker from '@/components/shipment/ShipmentTracker';

// In your component
<ShipmentTracker orderId={orderId} />
```

**For Seller Dashboard:**
```tsx
import CreateShipmentForm from '@/components/shipment/CreateShipmentForm';

// In your component
<CreateShipmentForm orderId={orderId} />
```

### 4. Test the Integration

1. Create a test order with shipping address
2. Use CreateShipmentForm to create a shipment
3. View tracking in ShipmentTracker
4. Test refresh functionality

## 📊 Status Workflow

```
Order Created (PAID)
    ↓
Seller Creates Shipment
    ↓
Order Status → SHIPPED
    ↓
Package Picked Up → PICKED_UP
    ↓
In Transit → IN_TRANSIT
    ↓
Out for Delivery → OUT_FOR_DELIVERY
    ↓
Delivered → DELIVERED
    ↓
Order Status → DELIVERED
```

## 🎯 Production Checklist

Before going to production:

- [ ] Get production PostNord API credentials
- [ ] Update `POSTNORD_ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] Test shipment creation with real addresses
- [ ] Verify label generation works
- [ ] Test tracking updates
- [ ] Set up error monitoring
- [ ] Configure email notifications (future enhancement)
- [ ] Test with different service codes
- [ ] Verify international shipping (if applicable)

## 🔒 Security Features

- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Role-based authorization (SELLER/ADMIN for creation)
- ✅ Order ownership verification
- ✅ API key stored in environment variables
- ✅ No sensitive data in client-side code

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Single Package per Order**: Currently supports one shipment per order
   - Future: Support multiple packages
   
2. **Manual Tracking Refresh**: Users must click refresh
   - Future: Implement webhooks for automatic updates
   
3. **No Return Labels**: Return shipments not yet supported
   - Future: Add return label generation

4. **No Cost Calculation**: Shipping costs not calculated
   - Future: Integrate PostNord pricing API

## 📈 Future Enhancements

1. **Webhook Integration**: Automatic tracking updates
2. **Email Notifications**: Send tracking updates to customers
3. **SMS Notifications**: Delivery notifications via SMS
4. **Service Point Selection**: Let customers choose pickup points
