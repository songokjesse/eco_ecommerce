## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

# PostNord API Configuration
POSTNORD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
POSTNORD_CUSTOMER_ID=your_customer_id_here
POSTNORD_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox  # or 'production'
```

### Getting PostNord Credentials

1. Visit [PostNord Developer Portal](https://developer.postnord.com/)
2. Create an account (Partner or Customer plan)
3. Generate API keys for sandbox/production
4. Note your Customer ID from the dashboard

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
The schema has already been updated. If you need to reset:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Update `.env.local` with your PostNord credentials.

### 3. Test in Sandbox
Start with sandbox environment to test integration:

```bash
POSTNORD_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
```

### 4. Integration Testing

**Create a test shipment:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/shipments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "orderId": "your_order_id",
    "serviceCode": "19",
    "weight": 1.0,
    "senderInfo": {
      "name": "Test Shop",
      "address": "Test Address 1",
      "city": "Stockholm",
      "postalCode": "11122",
      "countryCode": "SE"
    }
  }'
```

**Track a shipment:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/shipments/PNSE123456789/track
```

## Workflow

### For Sellers (Creating Shipments)

1. **Order Received**: Customer places order with shipping address
2. **Create Shipment**: Seller uses `CreateShipmentForm` to create shipment
3. **Generate Label**: PostNord returns shipping label PDF
4. **Print & Ship**: Seller prints label and ships package
5. **Status Updates**: Order status automatically updates to SHIPPED

### For Buyers (Tracking Orders)

1. **View Order**: Navigate to order details page
2. **Track Shipment**: `ShipmentTracker` component displays tracking info
3. **Refresh Updates**: Click refresh to get latest tracking events
4. **Delivery Confirmation**: Automatic status update when delivered

## Status Mapping

PostNord statuses are mapped to our internal `ShipmentStatus` enum:

| PostNord Status | Internal Status | Description |
|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Picked up | PICKED_UP | Package collected by carrier |
| In transit | IN_TRANSIT | Package in transit |
| Out for delivery | OUT_FOR_DELIVERY | Package out for delivery |
| Delivered | DELIVERED | Successfully delivered |
| Delivery failed | FAILED_DELIVERY | Delivery attempt failed |
| Returned | RETURNED | Returned to sender |

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling:

- **API Errors**: PostNord API errors are caught and returned with details
- **Authentication**: Unauthorized requests return 401
- **Authorization**: Non-sellers attempting to create shipments return 403
- **Validation**: Missing required fields return 400 with error details
- **Not Found**: Invalid order/shipment IDs return 404

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Webhook Integration**: Receive automatic tracking updates from PostNord
2. **Service Point Selection**: Allow customers to choose pickup points
3. **Multi-package Shipments**: Support splitting orders into multiple packages
4. **Return Labels**: Generate return shipping labels
5. **Cost Calculation**: Integrate PostNord pricing API
6. **Email Notifications**: Send tracking updates to customers
7. **SMS Notifications**: Send delivery notifications via SMS

## Troubleshooting

### "PostNord API credentials not configured"
- Ensure `POSTNORD_API_KEY` and `POSTNORD_CUSTOMER_ID` are set in `.env.local`
- Restart your development server after adding environment variables

### "Failed to create shipment"
- Check that the order has complete shipping information
- Verify sender information is complete and valid
- Ensure API key has correct permissions
- Check PostNord API status

### Tracking not updating
