# Complete Implementation Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Stripe Webhook - Orders Not Persisting
**Problem:** After successful payment, orders weren't being saved to the database.

**Root Cause:** Malformed webhook secret in `.env.local`

**Solution:**
- Fixed webhook secret format
- Enhanced webhook with comprehensive logging
- Added validation at every step
- Stores charge ID for refund tracking

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Enhanced with detailed logging
- `.env.local` - Fixed `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

---

### 2. ✅ Cart Not Clearing After Payment
**Problem:** Shopping cart still had items after successful payment.

**Standard Practice:** Cart should be automatically cleared after successful payment.

**Solution:**
- Added automatic cart clearing on success page
- Only clears with valid session ID
- Updates both state and localStorage

**Files Modified:**
- `app/success/page.tsx` - Added cart clearing logic
- `app/success/page-enhanced.tsx` - Created enhanced version with better UX

---

### 3. ✅ Inventory Not Restored on Refund/Cancellation
**Problem:** When orders are cancelled or refunded, inventory wasn't being restored.

**Solution:**
- Implemented automatic inventory restoration
- Handles Stripe refund webhooks
- Created manual cancellation API
- Updates product status (OUT_OF_STOCK → ACTIVE)

**Files Modified:**
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added refund tracking fields
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Added refund handler
- `app/api/orders/[orderId]/cancel/route.ts` - Manual cancellation endpoint

---

### 4. ✅ Next.js 15 Build Error
**Problem:** Production build failed with params type error.

**Solution:**
- Updated route handler to use Promise<params>
- Added await when accessing params

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/orders/[orderId]/cancel/route.ts` - Fixed params handling

---
