## 🎯 Key User Interface Elements

### Seller Orders Table

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Order ID | Shortened identifier |
| Customer | Name, email, location |
| Status | PAID, SHIPPED, DELIVERED |
| Items | Products from seller's shop |
| Total | Seller's earnings |
| Date | Order date |
| **Actions** | **Action buttons** |

### Action Buttons Logic

```typescript
// PAID order without shipment
if (order.status === 'PAID' && order.shipments.length === 0) {
  show: "Create Shipment" (blue button)
}

// Order with shipment
if (order.shipments.length > 0) {
  show: "View Tracking" (green button)
}

// Always show
show: "Details" (gray button)
```

---

## 📊 Database Integration

### Shipment Creation Flow

```typescript
// 1. Seller submits form
POST /api/shipments
{
  orderId: "order_123",
  serviceCode: "19",
  weight: 1.5,
  senderInfo: { ... }
}

// 2. API validates
- Check user is SELLER/ADMIN
- Verify order has shipping address
- Validate required fields

// 3. Call PostNord API
const shipment = await postnordClient.createShipment({
  sender: senderInfo,
  recipient: orderShippingAddress,
  parcel: packageDetails
});

// 4. Save to database
await prisma.shipment.create({
  orderId,
  trackingNumber: shipment.trackingNumber,
  status: 'PENDING',
  labelUrl: shipment.labelUrl,
  ...
});

// 5. Update order status
await prisma.order.update({
  where: { id: orderId },
  data: { status: 'SHIPPED' }
});

// 6. Return response with label URL
```
