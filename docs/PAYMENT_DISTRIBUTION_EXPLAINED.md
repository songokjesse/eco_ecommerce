# Payment Distribution: Sellers & Platform Owners

## 📊 Current State (What's Implemented)

### Current Payment Flow:

```
Buyer pays $100
    ↓
Stripe processes payment
    ↓
💰 ALL $100 goes to YOUR Stripe account (platform owner)
    ↓
Order created in database
    ↓
❌ Seller gets: $0 (no payout system exists)
❌ You keep: $100 (but you owe the seller!)
```

### What's Missing:

**NO seller payout system is currently implemented.** The database tracks:
- ✅ Orders and order items
- ✅ Which products were sold
- ✅ Which shop/seller owns each product
- ❌ **But NO tracking of:**
  - Platform commission/fees
  - Seller earnings
  - Payout status
  - Payout history

## 🎯 The Problem You Need to Solve

You're running a **multi-vendor marketplace** (like Etsy, Shopify, or Amazon Marketplace), which means:

1. **Multiple sellers** list products on your platform
2. **Buyers** purchase from different sellers
3. **You (platform)** need to:
   - Take a commission (e.g., 10% of each sale)
   - Pay sellers their share (e.g., 90% of each sale)
   - Handle the money flow securely and legally

### Example Scenario:

```
Seller A lists a product for $100
Buyer purchases it
    ↓
Who gets what?
├─ Seller A should get: $90 (90%)
└─ Platform (you) should get: $10 (10% commission)

But currently:
├─ Platform gets: $100 ❌
└─ Seller gets: $0 ❌
```

## 💡 Solution Options

### **Option 1: Stripe Connect (Recommended for Marketplaces)**

This is the **industry-standard solution** used by major platforms.

#### How It Works:

**1. Seller Onboarding:**
```
Seller signs up on your platform
    ↓
Clicks "Become a Seller"
    ↓
Redirected to Stripe Connect onboarding
    ↓
Seller provides:
├─ Business/personal information
├─ Bank account details
├─ Tax information (Stripe handles)
└─ Identity verification
    ↓
Stripe creates a "Connected Account" for seller
    ↓
Seller is now ready to receive payments
```

**2. When a Buyer Purchases:**

**Approach A: Application Fee (Simplest)**
```
Buyer pays $100
    ↓
Stripe processes payment
    ↓
Automatic split:
├─ $90 → Seller's Stripe account (instantly)
└─ $10 → Your Stripe account (your commission)
    ↓
Stripe automatically pays out:
├─ Seller: $90 to their bank (daily/weekly)
└─ You: $10 to your bank (daily/weekly)
```

**Approach B: Separate Charges & Transfers**
```
Buyer pays $100
    ↓
Money goes to YOUR Stripe account
    ↓
You manually trigger transfer:
├─ Transfer $90 to Seller's Stripe account
└─ Keep $10 as commission
    ↓
Stripe pays out to bank accounts
```

#### Database Changes Needed:

```prisma
model Shop {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Stripe Connect fields
  stripeAccountId      String?  // Seller's Stripe Connect account ID
  stripeAccountStatus  String?  // 'pending', 'active', 'restricted'
  payoutsEnabled       Boolean  @default(false)
  chargesEnabled       Boolean  @default(false)
}

model Order {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Payment split tracking
  platformFee          Decimal?  @db.Decimal(10, 2)  // Your commission
  sellerEarnings       Decimal?  @db.Decimal(10, 2)  // Seller's share
  stripeTransferId     String?   // Transfer ID if using transfers
}

model Payout {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())
  shopId            String
  shop              Shop     @relation(fields: [shopId], references: [id])
  
  amount            Decimal  @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  status            String   // 'pending', 'paid', 'failed'
  stripePayoutId    String?  // Stripe payout ID
  
  // Which orders are included in this payout
  orders            Order[]
  
  createdAt         DateTime @default(now())
  paidAt            DateTime?
}
```

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Integrate Stripe Connect:**
   - Add Stripe Connect onboarding flow
   - Store seller's `stripeAccountId` in database
   - Verify seller's account is active

2. **Modify Checkout:**
   - When creating Stripe session, specify:
     - Destination account (seller's Stripe account)
     - Application fee (your commission)
   
3. **Automatic Payouts:**
   - Stripe handles everything
   - Sellers get paid automatically
   - You get your commission automatically

#### Pros:
- ✅ **Fully automated** - No manual work
- ✅ **Secure** - Stripe handles all money movement
- ✅ **Compliant** - Tax forms, regulations handled
- ✅ **Scalable** - Works with 1 or 10,000 sellers
- ✅ **Trusted** - Used by Shopify, Etsy, Uber, Airbnb
- ✅ **Real-time** - Sellers can see earnings instantly
- ✅ **Dispute handling** - Stripe manages chargebacks

#### Cons:
- ⚠️ **Complex setup** - Requires significant development
- ⚠️ **Additional fees** - Stripe charges ~0.25% extra for Connect
- ⚠️ **Seller friction** - Sellers must complete onboarding
- ⚠️ **Verification delays** - Can take days for seller approval

#### Cost Example:
```
Sale: $100
Stripe processing fee: $3.20 (2.9% + $0.30)
Stripe Connect fee: $0.25 (0.25% of $100)
Total fees: $3.45

Distribution:
├─ Seller receives: $90 - $3.45 = $86.55
└─ Platform keeps: $10
```

### **Option 2: Manual Payouts (Simple but Labor-Intensive)**

Track earnings in your database and manually pay sellers.

#### How It Works:

**1. Track Earnings:**
```
When order is created:
├─ Calculate: sellerEarnings = orderTotal * 0.90
├─ Calculate: platformFee = orderTotal * 0.10
└─ Store in database with status = 'pending'
```

**2. Periodic Payouts (e.g., every Friday):**
```
You run a script/query:
├─ Find all pending earnings for each seller
├─ Sum up total owed to each seller
└─ Generate payout report

Example:
Seller A: $450 owed (from 5 orders)
Seller B: $270 owed (from 3 orders)
```

**3. Manual Payment:**
```
You manually:
├─ Log into your bank
├─ Transfer $450 to Seller A's bank account
├─ Transfer $270 to Seller B's bank account
├─ Update database: mark as 'paid'
└─ Send email receipts to sellers
```

#### Database Changes Needed:

```prisma
model Shop {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // Payout information
  bankAccountName   String?
  bankAccountNumber String?  // Encrypted!
  bankRoutingNumber String?  // Encrypted!
  paypalEmail       String?
  preferredPayoutMethod String?  // 'bank', 'paypal', 'check'
}

model Order {
  // ... existing fields
  
  platformFee       Decimal  @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  sellerEarnings    Decimal  @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  payoutStatus      String   @default('pending')  // 'pending', 'paid'
  paidAt            DateTime?
}

model PayoutBatch {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  shopId      String
  shop        Shop     @relation(fields: [shopId], references: [id])
  
  totalAmount Decimal  @db.Decimal(10, 2)
  orderIds    String[] // List of order IDs included
  status      String   // 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed'
  method      String   // 'bank_transfer', 'paypal', 'check'
  
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  paidAt      DateTime?
  notes       String?
}
```

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Seller Setup:**
   - Add "Bank Account" settings page
   - Sellers enter their bank details
   - **IMPORTANT:** Encrypt sensitive data!

2. **Order Processing:**
   - When order is created, calculate splits:
     ```
     platformFee = total * 0.10
     sellerEarnings = total * 0.90
     ```

3. **Payout Dashboard:**
   - Admin page showing:
     - Pending payouts per seller
     - Total owed
     - Payout history

4. **Manual Process:**
   - Weekly/monthly: Export payout report
   - Manually transfer money
   - Mark orders as paid

#### Pros:
- ✅ **Simple to start** - No complex integration
- ✅ **Full control** - You decide when/how to pay
- ✅ **No extra fees** - Just standard bank transfer fees
- ✅ **Flexible** - Can negotiate custom terms

#### Cons:
- ❌ **Time-consuming** - Hours of work per payout cycle
- ❌ **Error-prone** - Easy to make mistakes
- ❌ **Delayed payments** - Sellers wait weeks for money
- ❌ **Doesn't scale** - Impossible with 100+ sellers
- ❌ **Security risk** - You handle sensitive bank data
- ❌ **Trust issues** - Sellers must trust you
- ❌ **Accounting nightmare** - Manual reconciliation

### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Stripe Transfers)**

Use Stripe to handle transfers, but you control timing.

#### How It Works:

**1. Seller Setup:**
```
Seller connects Stripe account (simplified onboarding)
OR
Seller provides bank account → You create Stripe recipient
```

**2. When Buyer Pays:**
```
Buyer pays $100
    ↓
ALL money goes to YOUR Stripe account
    ↓
Database tracks:
├─ Seller A is owed: $90
└─ Platform earned: $10
```

**3. Scheduled Payouts:**
```
Every Friday (automated script):
├─ Query database for pending earnings
├─ Use Stripe Transfer API:
    stripe.transfers.create({
      amount: 9000,  // $90 in cents
      currency: 'usd',
      destination: 'acct_SellerStripeID',
    })
├─ Update database: mark as paid
└─ Send notification to seller
```

#### Pros:
- ✅ **Automated transfers** - Stripe handles movement
- ✅ **You control timing** - Pay weekly/monthly
- ✅ **Secure** - Stripe manages bank details
- ✅ **Scalable** - API handles bulk transfers

#### Cons:
- ⚠️ **Still requires Connect** - Sellers need Stripe accounts
- ⚠️ **You hold funds** - Regulatory implications
- ⚠️ **Delayed payouts** - Not instant like Option 1
