# Quick Fix Guide for Stripe Webhook Issues

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your webhook secret in `.env.local` is malformed. This is likely why orders aren't being saved.

### Fix the Webhook Secret

**Current (WRONG):**
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=wwhsec_xxxxx
```

**Option 1: Local Testing (Recommended for Development)**

1. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   ./test-webhook.sh
   ```

2. Copy the webhook secret that appears (starts with `whsec_`)

3. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx  # Use the actual secret from step 2
   ```

4. Restart your dev server

**Option 2: Use the Existing Secret**

If the second part of your secret is valid, update `.env.local` to:
```
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxß
```

## 🔧 Complete Setup Steps

### 1. Fix Environment Variables

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
# Clerk Webhook (for user sync)
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx  # Get from Clerk Dashboard

# Stripe Webhook (already exists, just fix it)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxx  # Fix as described above
```

### 2. Set Up Clerk Webhook (Important!)

This ensures users exist in your database before orders are created.

1. Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. Select your application
3. Go to "Webhooks" in the sidebar
4. Click "Add Endpoint"
5. Enter endpoint URL:
   - **Local:** Use ngrok or similar: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - **Production:** `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/clerk`
6. Subscribe to events:
   - `user.created`
   - `user.updated`
   - `user.deleted`
7. Copy the "Signing Secret" and add to `.env.local` as `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### 3. Test Locally

#### Terminal 1: Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Terminal 2: Forward Stripe Webhooks
```bash
./test-webhook.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

#### Terminal 3: Trigger Test Event
```bash
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

### 4. Verify Order Creation

After completing a test payment, check:

```bash
# Open Prisma Studio to view database
npx prisma studio
```

Look for:
- ✅ New order in `Order` table
- ✅ Order items in `OrderItem` table
- ✅ Updated inventory in `Product` table
